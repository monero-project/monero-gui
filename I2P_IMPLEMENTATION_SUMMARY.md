## Technical Details

### Modular Architecture
The I2P integration has been designed with a modular architecture to ensure maintainability and flexibility:

1. **I2PDaemonManager** - Manages the lifecycle of the I2P daemon, provides API for starting/stopping and configuration
2. **wallet2 I2P methods** - Core implementation of I2P functionality within the wallet backend
3. **API Layer** - Wallet and WalletManager interfaces for I2P settings and control
4. **Settings Layer** - MoneroSettings integration for persistent I2P configuration
5. **GUI Components** - QML components for user interaction with I2P features

### I2P Configuration Settings
The following settings are configurable by users:
- **Enable I2P** - Toggles I2P routing on/off
- **Use Built-in I2P Daemon** - Use the bundled I2P daemon or an external one
- **I2P Address** - Address of the I2P router (default: 127.0.0.1)
- **I2P Port** - Port of the I2P router (default: 7656)
- **Mixed Mode** - Allow connections to both I2P and non-I2P nodes
- **Tunnel Length** - Number of hops in the I2P tunnel (affects anonymity vs. speed)

### Connection Flow
1. User enables I2P in settings
2. Settings are applied to wallet2 via API layer
3. When wallet connects to network, traffic is routed through I2P
4. I2P peer discovery is used to find other I2P-enabled Monero nodes
5. Status indicator shows I2P connection state

### Build Instructions
To build the Monero GUI wallet with I2P support:
```
cmake -DWITH_I2P=ON ..
make
```

The I2P integration will automatically download and configure the required I2P daemon during the build process.

### Testing Instructions
To verify the I2P implementation:
```
cd i2p_implementation
.\verify_implementation.ps1
```

To run the full test suite:
```
cd i2p_implementation
.\i2p_testing_script.ps1
```
