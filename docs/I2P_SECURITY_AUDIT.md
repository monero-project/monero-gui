# I2P Integration Security Audit Checklist

This document provides a checklist for conducting a security audit of the I2P integration in Monero GUI.

## Network Security

### IP Leakage Prevention
- [ ] Verify all wallet connections use I2P when enabled
- [ ] Verify no clearnet connections are made when I2P is enabled (unless mixed mode is enabled)
- [ ] Verify DNS requests are properly routed through I2P
- [ ] Verify WebRTC and other potential IP leak vectors are mitigated

### Tunnel Configuration
- [ ] Verify tunnel lengths are sufficient for anonymity
- [ ] Verify tunnel quantities are sufficient for reliability
- [ ] Verify tunnel creation parameters are secure
- [ ] Verify tunnel rotation is properly implemented

### Proxy Implementation
- [ ] Verify SOCKS proxy implementation is correct
- [ ] Verify proxy settings are properly applied to all network connections
- [ ] Verify proxy authentication (if used) is secure
- [ ] Verify no proxy bypass vulnerabilities exist

## I2P Daemon Security

### Binary Integrity
- [ ] Verify i2pd binary is obtained from a trusted source
- [ ] Verify i2pd binary signatures are checked
- [ ] Verify i2pd binary is not modified after download
- [ ] Verify i2pd binary is updated when security patches are available

### Process Security
- [ ] Verify i2pd process has minimal privileges
- [ ] Verify i2pd process is properly sandboxed
- [ ] Verify i2pd process cannot be hijacked
- [ ] Verify i2pd process termination is handled gracefully

### Configuration Security
- [ ] Verify i2pd configuration files have appropriate permissions
- [ ] Verify sensitive information is not exposed in configuration files
- [ ] Verify default configuration is secure
- [ ] Verify user configuration changes are validated

## Wallet Integration Security

### API Security
- [ ] Verify I2P-related API calls are properly authenticated
- [ ] Verify I2P settings cannot be manipulated by unauthorized parties
- [ ] Verify I2P status information is accurate
- [ ] Verify error handling doesn't reveal sensitive information

### Transaction Security
- [ ] Verify transactions through I2P maintain same security properties as clearnet
- [ ] Verify transaction broadcasting through I2P is reliable
- [ ] Verify no transaction information is leaked during I2P connection issues
- [ ] Verify transaction privacy is maintained in mixed mode

### Key Management
- [ ] Verify I2P keys are properly generated and stored
- [ ] Verify I2P keys are properly protected
- [ ] Verify I2P keys are properly backed up with wallet
- [ ] Verify I2P keys are properly restored with wallet

## User Interface Security

### Settings Security
- [ ] Verify I2P settings cannot be manipulated through UI vulnerabilities
- [ ] Verify I2P status indicator accurately reflects actual connection status
- [ ] Verify error messages don't reveal sensitive information
- [ ] Verify settings validation prevents insecure configurations

### User Awareness
- [ ] Verify users are properly informed about I2P status
- [ ] Verify users are warned about potential privacy implications
- [ ] Verify users are notified of connection issues
- [ ] Verify documentation clearly explains security considerations

## Threat Modeling

### Attack Vectors
- [ ] Identify and assess potential network-level attacks
- [ ] Identify and assess potential application-level attacks
- [ ] Identify and assess potential OS-level attacks
- [ ] Identify and assess potential social engineering attacks

### Mitigations
- [ ] Document mitigations for each identified attack vector
- [ ] Verify mitigations are properly implemented
- [ ] Verify mitigations are tested under various conditions
- [ ] Verify mitigations don't introduce new vulnerabilities

## Testing Methodology

### Network Testing
- [ ] Use network analysis tools to verify all traffic is routed through I2P
- [ ] Test with various network configurations and restrictions
- [ ] Test with network interruptions and failures
- [ ] Test with malicious network conditions

### Penetration Testing
- [ ] Attempt to bypass I2P routing
- [ ] Attempt to extract IP address through various methods
- [ ] Attempt to manipulate I2P settings
- [ ] Attempt to compromise I2P daemon

### Long-term Testing
- [ ] Verify I2P connection stability over extended periods
- [ ] Verify resource usage remains stable over time
- [ ] Verify no memory leaks or resource exhaustion occurs
- [ ] Verify proper handling of network changes over time

## Reporting

The security audit report should include:

1. Executive summary
2. Methodology used
3. Findings categorized by severity
4. Recommendations for each finding
5. Overall security assessment
6. Suggested improvements

## Remediation Plan

For each security issue identified:

1. Assign a severity level
2. Determine required fixes
3. Establish timeline for implementation
4. Verify fixes after implementation
