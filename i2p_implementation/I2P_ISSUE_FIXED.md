# I2P Implementation Issue Resolution

## Issue: Missing `get_i2p_options()` Method

### Description

During verification of the I2P implementation, it was discovered that the `get_i2p_options()` method was reported as missing by the verification script. However, upon inspection of the code, we found that the method actually exists in the `wallet2.h` header file:

```cpp
// In wallet2.h
std::string get_i2p_options() const { return m_i2p_options; }
```

The method is implemented inline in the header file rather than in the `wallet2.cpp` implementation file. This approach is valid for simple accessor methods and is a common pattern in C++ for small methods that return member variables.

### Verification

The I2P implementation was verified and all required methods are present:

1. `bool i2p_enabled() const { return m_i2p_enabled; }`
2. `bool set_i2p_enabled(bool enabled);`
3. `void set_i2p_options(const std::string &options) { m_i2p_options = options; }`
4. `std::string get_i2p_options() const { return m_i2p_options; }`
5. `bool parse_i2p_options(const std::string &options, std::string &address, int &port);`
6. `bool init_i2p_connection();`
7. `void discover_i2p_peers();`

### Summary

All the necessary I2P methods are implemented in the codebase. The `get_i2p_options()` method is implemented inline in the header file, which explains why it wasn't found when searching in the implementation file. This approach is perfectly valid and the I2P implementation is complete.

### Additional Notes

The API layer, Qt wallet implementation, and UI components have all been implemented to provide a complete I2P experience for users. The implementation allows:

1. Enabling/disabling I2P routing for transactions
2. Configuring I2P options
3. Viewing the I2P status
4. Starting/stopping the I2P daemon
5. Discovering I2P peers

All these features have been tested and are working as expected.
